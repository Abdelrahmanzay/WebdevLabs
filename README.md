# WebdevLabs

This repository contains small web development lab exercises .. Each lab is a self-contained folder with HTML/CSS/JS you can open in a browser.

Structure (top-level folders):

- `Lab2/` — Portfolio demo (HTML + CSS)
- `Lab3/` — Calculator demo
- `Lab4/` — Todo demo
- `Lab5/` — Movies Watch List (React demo, no-build; uses CDN and in-browser Babel)

Notes about `Lab5`

- `Lab5` contains a small React app that runs without npm using React/ReactDOM from a CDN and Babel to transpile JSX in the browser. This is suitable for demos but not production.
- If you plan to develop the React app further, consider converting `Lab5` into a proper project with a bundler (Vite or Create React App). I can scaffold that if you want.
- Note: the React and CSS code in `Lab5` were written by me during the lab using CodeSandbox (I didn't install React locally); I then copied the files into VS Code so I could push them to GitHub. The React and CSS were authored by me, not generated by AI. The HTML shell was AI-assisted to wire the CDN setup.

## Lab6 – Simplified React Vite Project

Lab6 is a pared-down React project using Vite. It was simplified to make the code easier to read and understand.

### Purpose

Provide a minimal example of a React landing page with very little styling and only one main component instead of many small ones.

### Current Structure

```
Lab6/
	index.html
	package.json
	vite.config.js
	src/
		main.jsx        # mounts the app
		UdemyLandingPage.jsx  # single simplified component (header, hero, courses, footer)
		index.css       # minimal styles
```

### Dependencies

- React / ReactDOM (version per `package.json`)
- Vite for dev server and build

### How to Run

```powershell
Push-Location "C:\Users\abdra\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\WebdevLabs\Lab6"
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the shown local URL (usually http://localhost:5173/).
