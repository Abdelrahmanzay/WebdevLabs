# WebdevLabs

This repository contains small web development lab exercises .. Each lab is a self-contained folder with HTML/CSS/JS you can open in a browser.

Structure (top-level folders):

- `Lab2/` — Portfolio demo (HTML + CSS)
- `Lab3/` — Calculator demo
- `Lab4/` — Todo demo
- `Lab5/` — Movies Watch List (React demo, no-build; uses CDN and in-browser Babel)


Notes about `Lab5`

- `Lab5` contains a small React app that runs without npm using React/ReactDOM from a CDN and Babel to transpile JSX in the browser. This is suitable for demos but not production.
- If you plan to develop the React app further, consider converting `Lab5` into a proper project with a bundler (Vite or Create React App). I can scaffold that if you want.
- Note: the React and CSS code in `Lab5` were written by me during the lab using CodeSandbox (I didn't install React locally); I then copied the files into VS Code so I could push them to GitHub. The React and CSS were authored by me, not generated by AI.
-But the html part written by AI so i can run React(CDN/BABEL)
